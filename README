Temporary secret encryption and decryption for Linux. You're supposed to decrypt the secrets for a read or a modification, then encrypt them back immediately after. Doesn't save from a scanning of your storage device, but does help from programs knocking on your filesystem

DEPENDENCIES YOU NEED:
* gpg
* tar with zstd
* bash

You can put a similar thing in your ~/.bashrc:

```
shite() {
    TARGET=/path/to/secrets/directory /path/to/shitcryption.sh "$@"
}
```

Then, use

```
shite
```

to make the first encryption,

```
shite
```

to decrypt, and

```
shite
```

to make subsequent encryptions. It will tell you if it just encrypted or decrypted your stuff
